#Santa Clara Walking Tour

This website is a family site for international cultural exchange from a to Cuba. The idea was designed for our marriage. After years of working in universities and schools of Cuba, we decided to move from Orient region of Cuba to Santa Clara a city of Central region of Cuba. The permanent exchange with turist in the central region, make possible to figure out the needs of Cuba's visitors.

After the possibilitie to have free Internet across Wifi, we decide to realize this website about the real Cuba from our point of views.
