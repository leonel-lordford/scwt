#Santa Clara Walking Tour

This website is a family site for international cultural exchange. The idea was designed by a foreign friend and us, a Cuban couple. After years of working in universities and schools of Cuba, we decided to move from the eastern region to Santa Clara, a city in the center. The permanent exchange with turists, mainly in the Cayo Santa Maria Tourist Resort, helped us to figure out the needs of Cuba's visitors.

Right after we began to have free Internet through the Wifi, we decided to materialize our dream: help foreign friends who come to Cuba with basic and important things like lodging, transport, language barriers, etc; all through this website about the real Cuba from our point of view.

***This website is a family site for international cultural exchange. Our experience with tourists, friends and clients from our job in a tourist resort, helped us figure out the needs of Cuba's visitors. So our main goal is to help foreign friends who come to Cuba with basic and important things like lodging, transport, language barriers, etc; by means of this website about the real Cuba from our point of view.
